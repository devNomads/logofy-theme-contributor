# {dev}Nomads Logofy

A [Liferay](https://www.liferay.com) theme contributor with one simple task: replacing occurrences of the word "devnomads" with a version with brackets around {dev} and using the logo's colors.

The javascript that I used for the DOM walking is coming from this [thread on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6012163/whats-a-good-alternative-to-html-rewriting/11582922#11582922).
